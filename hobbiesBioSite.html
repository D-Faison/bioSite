                    <h3>Metaphysics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Metaphysics was considered a science back then but is now a branch of 
                        philosophy. To put it simply, it explores our reality, our existence, 
                        what we are beyond our physical bodies. Abstract Concepts like time, 
                        space, and human identity. Metaphysics explores a question 
                        like "Do humans have souls?" and "What are the components of a reality?".

                    <h3>Meditation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Meditation is practice that involves clearing the mind. 
                        Clearing your mind is much easier said than done; as it is not only 
                        about clearing the mind but being present in the moment. 
                        During mediation, you are not thinking of yourself but of being in 
                        the moment without analyitical thinking.

                    <h3>Creation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whether it be cooking, doing hair, the ability to create is a 
                        hobby she also enjoys. Particularly, creating jewelry as a form of 
                        art she finds meditative. Using feathers from nature, pouring her 
                        time and energy hand crafting each piece for each earring she 
                        creates. The act becomes a ritual of mindfulness and the finished 
                        piece is not only a beautiful reflection of the soul but a 
                        reminder of inner peace and purpose.
