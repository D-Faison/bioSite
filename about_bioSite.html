                <span style="font-weight: 500;">Crystal</span> is one who is in tune with the world around her, 
                and enjoys learning deeper about her place in the universe and other’s.  
                She enjoys the study of metaphysics and decorating; which reflect upon herself as she is 
                always changing, evolving and growing. A skill she is particularly proud of is 
                creating what ever she can conjure up in her mind, whether it be how she wants a room 
                decorated, something she wants to make or creating relationships with people across 
                the country. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Her goals in life are to not only finish fixing up the home she is currently 
                in but buying a home for her family. Her biggest motivation in her life is 
                her family; and her crowning achievement is her youngest and only son Egypt. 
                As he is a reflection of her, kind, helpful, energetic, can light up a room 
                and an overall wonderful person to be around. To achieve these goals for her 
                motivations and achievement, her biggest asset is to keep things written down 
                in a check list. Using an array of journals she often keeps track of her 
                progress, her thoughts, what is and isn’t working and so on.

                Describing herself in one word, she answered 
                “Human”; tying into her metaphysical state of mind. 
                When asked, if she were a crayon what color would she be, she replied:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-style: italic; color: #4a1d6d;">“Indigo fields; when I meditate it is always the first color I see in a 
                    giant field”.</span> Her kind and peaceful nature as she is meditating reflects in 
                that of a calm swaying field of flowers.
