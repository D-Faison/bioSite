                        Crystal is one who is in tune with the world around her, and enjoys 
                        learning deeper about her place in the universe and other’s. She enjoys 
                        the study of metaphysics and decorating; which reflect upon herself as 
                        she is always changing, evolving and growing. A skill she is particularly 
                        proud of is creating what ever she can conjure up in her mind, whether it 
                        be how she wants a room decorated, something she wants to make or creating
                         relationships with people across the country.

                        Her goals in life are to not only finish fixing up the home she is 
                        currently in but buying a home for her family. Her biggest motivation 
                        in her life is her family; and her crowning achievement is her youngest
                        and only son Egypt. As he is a reflection of her, kind, helpful, 
                        energetic, can light up a room and an overall wonderful person to be 
                        around. To achieve these goals for her motivations and achievement, her 
                        biggest asset is to keep things written down in a check list. 
                        Using an array of journals she often keeps track of her progress, 
                        her thoughts, what is and isn’t working and so on.

                        Describing herself in one word, she answered “Human”; 
                        tying into her metaphysical state of mind. When asked, 
                        if she were a crayon what color would she be, she replied:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Indigo fields; when I meditate it is always the first color 
                        I see in a giant field”. Her kind and peaceful nature as she is 
                        meditating reflects in that of a calm swaying field of flowers.
