                    <h3>Metaphysics</h3>
                    <p>Metaphysics was considered a <i>science </i>back then but is now a branch of philosophy. 
                    To put it simply, it explores our reality, our existence, what we are beyond our physical bodies. 
                    <b>Abstract Concepts</b> like time, space, and human identity. Metaphysics explores a question like
                    <i>"Do humans have souls?"</i> and <i>"What are the components of a reality?"</i>.

                    <h3>Meditation</h3>
                    <p> Meditation is practice that involves <i>clearing the mind</i>. Clearing your mind is 
                        much easier said than done; as it is not only about clearing the mind but being present
                        in the moment. During mediation, <i>you are not thinking of yourself</i> but of being in the 
                        moment without analyitical thinking.

                    <h3>Creation</h3>
                    <p> Whether it be cooking, doing hair, the ability to create is a hobby she also enjoys.
                        Particularly, creating jewelry as a form of art she finds meditative. Using feathers from 
                        nature, pouring her time and energy hand crafting each piece for each earring she creates.
                        The act becomes a ritual of mindfulness and the finished piece is not only a beautiful reflection 
                        of the soul but a reminder of inner peace and purpose.
